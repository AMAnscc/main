<h1>About cats</h1>
<p>1. The first year of a cat’s life is roughly equal to the first 15 years of human life.
    Your cat’s second year is roughly equal to the first 25 of a human's. After that, your cat tends to develop more slowly and ages about four to five human years every 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees.
    While humans have six muscles in both of their outer ears, cats have 32 muscles in each of theirs! These muscles give cats the ability to swivel and rotate their ears to pinpoint the exact source of a noise.</p>
<p>3. The hearing of the average cat is at least five times stronger than that of a human adult.
    Cat hearing is extremely sensitive and can hear tones at much higher pitches than humans. This gives them an advantage in nature, as most of their prey, such as rodents or birds, make high-pitched sounds.</p>
